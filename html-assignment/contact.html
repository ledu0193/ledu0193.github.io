            Some of the stuff I'm into includes watching scary movies – the kind that gets your heart racing and makes you jump out of your seat. I can't resist the thrill and suspense they bring!

            I'm also a big fan of late-night drives. There's something special about hitting the road when everyone else is asleep. It's like a mini adventure, a chance to clear my mind, and the quiet streets have this calming vibe.

            And then, there's Pokémon Go. Yeah, I know, it might sound a bit nerdy, but I absolutely love it! Running around catching Pokémon, meeting fellow players, and discovering new places in the process. It's a blast, and I can't get enough of it.
